- Audit trails and governance

### CONS ‚ùå
**Initial Complexity**
- Learning curve for Azure services
- Initial setup time (1-2 weeks)
- Need to containerize application
- CI/CD pipeline setup required

**Ongoing Costs**
- Monthly Azure costs (~$100-300/month estimated)
- Bandwidth costs for audio streaming
- Storage costs for audio files
- OpenAI API costs (unchanged)

**Dependencies**
- Reliant on Azure availability
- Internet connectivity required
- Vendor lock-in to Microsoft ecosystem

- Use existing hardware
- No cloud migration needed
- Familiar environment

**Cost Control**
- No monthly cloud costs
- One-time setup effort
- Existing infrastructure utilization
- Predictable expenses

**Data Control**
- All data stays on-premises
- No data transfer to cloud
- Direct file system access
- Local network security

**Simplicity**
- Single machine deployment
- Direct troubleshooting
- No container complexity
- Straightforward debugging

### CONS ‚ùå
**Reliability Risks**
- Single point of failure
- No automatic failover
- Dependent on local internet
- Hardware failure risks

**Maintenance Burden**
- Manual updates required
- Security patches needed
- Backup management
- Monitoring setup required

**Scalability Limitations**
- Fixed processing capacity
- No auto-scaling
- Manual intervention for issues
- Limited concurrent processing

**Professional Limitations**
- No enterprise auth integration
- Limited audit capabilities
- Basic monitoring only
- Manual disaster recovery

## Next Steps

### For Local Automation (This Week):
1. Set up Windows Task Scheduler
2. Create monitoring scripts
3. Implement backup strategy
4. Add error handling and alerts

### For Azure Planning (Next Month):
1. Create Azure account and resource group
2. Containerize the application
3. Set up development environment
4. Plan migration strategy

**RECOMMENDATION: Start with local automation to get immediate value, then plan Azure migration for enterprise deployment.**
