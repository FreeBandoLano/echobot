# Monday (Oct 14) Automation Test - What to Expect

## Current System Status (Oct 12)

### ‚úÖ Everything Looks Good!

Based on your verification output:

1. **Configuration**: All checks passed ‚úÖ
2. **Recent History**: 
   - Oct 8: 4/4 blocks completed, digest created ‚úÖ
   - Oct 9: 4/4 blocks completed, digest created ‚úÖ
   - Oct 10: 4/4 blocks completed, digest created ‚úÖ
3. **Weekend Behavior**: Correctly skipping Sat/Sun ‚úÖ
4. **Ready for Monday**: System properly configured ‚úÖ

### üìã About "No tasks in queue"

**This is actually GOOD!** Here's why:

- Tasks are **ephemeral** (temporary)
- They get created ‚Üí processed ‚Üí completed ‚Üí eventually cleaned up
- Empty queue means: No stuck tasks, no pending work
- On Monday morning, new tasks will be created automatically

The task queue workflow:
```
Block A finishes ‚Üí TRANSCRIBE_BLOCK task created
                 ‚Üí Task processes (completed)
                 ‚Üí SUMMARIZE_BLOCK task created
                 ‚Üí Task processes (completed)
                 ‚Üí (repeat for B, C, D)
                 ‚Üí All 4 blocks done ‚Üí CREATE_DAILY_DIGEST task created
                 ‚Üí Digest created ‚Üí EMAIL_DAILY_DIGEST task created
                 ‚Üí Email sent ‚Üí All tasks eventually cleaned up
```

### üìß About "Email NOT sent"

You mentioned you manually sent those digests - that's fine! The database just doesn't have the `email_sent` flag set because they were sent via manual script rather than the automated task manager flow.

**Optional cleanup** (not required): You can run `mark_digests_emailed.py` in Azure SSH to update those records for cleaner reporting.

## Monday (Oct 14) - Hour-by-Hour Expectations

### 9:55 AM - Pre-Flight Check
```bash
# Start watching logs
az webapp log tail --name echobot-docker-app --resource-group echobot-rg
```

**Look for:**
- "Scheduler started successfully"
- "Task manager started"
- No error messages

---

### 10:00 AM - Block A Starts (2 hours)

**Expected logs:**
```
10:00:05 - Scheduler: Recording scheduled for Block A
10:00:10 - Starting recording for Block A (Morning Block)
10:00:15 - Recording audio from stream: https://ice66...
```

**What's happening:**
- Scheduler detects it's 10:00 AM (scheduled time)
- Starts recording from radio stream
- Saves audio to `/audio/2025-10-14_A.mp3`
- Creates block record in database (status: `recorded`)

---

### 12:00 PM - Block A Ends, Processing Starts

### 2:01:35 PM - üéØ THE MAGIC MOMENT

**This is when automation really shows its power!**

**Expected logs:**
```
2:01:35 - Task_manager: All 4 blocks completed for 2025-10-14
2:01:36 - Task_manager: Scheduling digest creation...

2:02:22 - Task #130: CREATE_DAILY_DIGEST completed ‚úÖ
2:02:23 - Task #131: EMAIL_DAILY_DIGEST added to queue
```

**What's happening:**
- Task_manager detects all 4 blocks are `completed`
- Automatically schedules digest creation (no manual intervention!)

- Generates comprehensive daily digest (~4000 words)
- Saves to `daily_digests` table

---

### 2:02:25 PM - Email Sending

**Expected logs:**
```
2:02:25 - Task #131: Running email delivery...
2:02:26 - Preparing digest email for 2025-10-14
2:02:27 - Subject: [Brass Tacks] Daily Brief ‚Äì October 14, 2025
2:02:28 - Recipients: 3 addresses

```

**What's happening:**
- Task_manager picks up email task
- Connects to Gmail SMTP server
- Sends email to all 3 recipients
- Marks digest as `emailed` in database
- Creates lock to prevent duplicate sends

---

### 2:03 PM - ‚úÖ AUTOMATION COMPLETE!

**Expected outcome:**
- ‚úÖ All 4 blocks recorded, transcribed, summarized
- ‚úÖ Daily digest created (4000 words)
- ‚úÖ Email delivered to all 3 recipients
- ‚úÖ Zero manual intervention needed!

---

## How to Monitor in Real-Time

### Option 1: Watch Logs (Recommended)
```bash
# In a terminal, start streaming logs before 10 AM
az webapp log tail --name echobot-docker-app --resource-group echobot-rg
```

**Pro tip**: Keep this running in a terminal window all day. You'll see exactly what's happening in real-time!

### Option 2: Check Web UI Periodically
Visit: https://echobot-docker-app.azurewebsites.net

**Check at:**
- 12:05 PM (should see Block A completed)
- 12:35 PM (should see Blocks A, B completed)
- 1:35 PM (should see Blocks A, B, C completed)
- 2:05 PM (should see all 4 blocks + digest)

### Option 3: Re-run Verification Script
```bash
# SSH into Azure
az webapp ssh --name echobot-docker-app --resource-group echobot-rg

# Check status
cd /app
python3 verify_automation_azure.py
```

**Run at:**
- 9:55 AM (pre-flight check)
- 2:05 PM (verify everything completed)

---

## Success Criteria

### ‚úÖ Automation is working if:

1. **Recording**: All 4 blocks show status `completed` by 2 PM
2. **Processing**: Each block has transcript and summary files
3. **Digest**: Daily digest exists in database for 2025-10-14
4. **Email**: All 3 recipients receive email by 2:35 PM
5. **Logs**: No error messages in Azure logs
6. **Tasks**: Task queue shows completed tasks (or empty after cleanup)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues to watch for:

1. **Recording fails**: Check RADIO_STREAM_URL is accessible
2. **Transcription fails**: Check OpenAI API key and quota
3. **No digest created**: Check DIGEST_CREATOR=task_manager
4. **Email not sent**: Check ENABLE_EMAIL=true and SMTP config
5. **Tasks stuck**: Check task_manager is running

---

## If Something Goes Wrong

### Step 1: Check the Logs
```bash
az webapp log tail --name echobot-docker-app --resource-group echobot-rg
```

Look for any lines with:
- `ERROR`
- `EXCEPTION`
- `FAILED`

### Step 2: Run Verification
```bash
az webapp ssh --name echobot-docker-app --resource-group echobot-rg
cd /app
python3 verify_automation_azure.py
```

This will show you:
- Which blocks completed
- Whether digest was created
- Task queue status
- Configuration issues

### Step 3: Check Task Queue
```bash
# In Azure SSH
cd /app
python3 -c "
import os
os.environ['USE_AZURE_SQL'] = 'true'
from database import db
from sqlalchemy import text

conn = db.get_connection()
result = conn.execute(text(\"SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE show_date = '2025-10-14' ORDER BY created_at DESC\"))
print('Recent tasks for Oct 14:')
for row in result:
    print(f'  {row.task_type}: {row.status}')
conn.close()
"
```

### Step 4: Manual Generation (Last Resort)
```bash
# In Azure SSH
cd /app
python3 load_env_and_run.py

# Follow prompts:
# - Date: 2025-10-14
# - Regenerate? N (use existing if available)
# - Send email? Y
```

## After Monday - Going Forward

### If automation works perfectly Monday:
1. ‚úÖ Mark Monday as successful in your notes
2. ‚úÖ You can stop monitoring so closely
3. ‚úÖ Just check email each day around 2:30 PM
4. ‚úÖ Review digest content to ensure quality
5. ‚úÖ System will run on autopilot from then on!

### Recommended ongoing monitoring:
- **Daily**: Check email arrives (~2:30 PM)
- **Weekly**: Quick review of digest quality
- **Monthly**: Run `verify_automation_azure.py` to check health
- **As needed**: Check logs if email doesn't arrive

---
