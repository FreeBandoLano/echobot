🔒 EXECUTIVE BRIEFING
─────────────────────
The "Down to Brass Tacks" program on September 24, 2025, opened with the moderator setting a tone of urgent public accountability and pragmatic governance ahead of the upcoming general elections. The host framed the day's discourse around three interlinked pillars: public safety, governance transparency, and socio-economic policy clarity.

💬 Opening remarks emphasized the need for candid dialogue between government officials and citizens, stating, "Today, we peel back the layers on what truly matters to Barbadians — safety in our streets, clarity in our policies, and trust in those who govern us."

The moderator underscored the importance of addressing the mounting concerns over police resource allocation and immigration regulations, highlighting that these issues have dominated public discourse in recent weeks. By explicitly referencing recent controversies, such as the policing coverage in Hawthorne and the impending October 1 immigration fee changes, the host signaled an agenda focused on holding authorities accountable and demanding concrete government action.

🎯 KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY
───────────────────────
The September 24 edition of "Down to Brass Tacks" provided a comprehensive snapshot of public sentiment and emerging policy concerns in Barbados as the nation approaches its general elections. Across four program blocks and 61 callers, the discourse coalesced around four dominant themes:

🔸 Public safety and police resource management
🔸 Immigration policy clarity and free movement regulations  
🔸 Education reform and employment alignment
🔸 Governance transparency coupled with public trust in government institutions

The morning block foregrounded urgent concerns about policing in Hawthorne, with callers highlighting staffing shortages, inadequate patrol coverage, and long shifts that compromise public safety. These concerns were linked to broader governance questions, with demands for transparent records of political achievements and accountability from both the ruling Democratic Labour Party (DLP) and opposition Barbados Labour Party (BLP).
