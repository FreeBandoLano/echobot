# Enhanced Summarization System

## Overview

The Radio Synopsis application now includes a comprehensive enhanced summarization system designed for government intelligence analysis. This system generates 4000-word structured daily digests with detailed sections for policy analysis, sentiment tracking, and conversation evolution.

## Key Features

### 1. Structured Daily Digests
- **Target Length**: 4000 words (up from ~400 characters)
- **Structured Output**: JSON-based sections for enhanced parsing and display
- **Government Focus**: Designed for Prime Minister's office and senior civil servants
- **Election Monitoring**: Tracks public sentiment ahead of upcoming elections

### 2. Enhanced Sections

#### Preamble (300 words)
- Program introduction and participation context
- Significance for government monitoring

#### Executive Summary (500 words)
- Comprehensive overview of main themes
- Critical issues and overall public sentiment
- Immediate government concerns

#### Topics Overview (800 words)
- Detailed analysis of all major topics discussed
- Topic prioritization by public engagement
- Cross-block topic evolution
- Sentiment analysis per topic
- Policy implications for each major theme

#### Conversation Evolution (600 words)
- Tracks how discussions evolved throughout the program
- Opening themes vs closing themes
- Sentiment shifts during the program
- How callers influenced each other
- Moderator guidance and steering
- Emerging consensus or divisions

#### Moderator Analysis (400 words)
- How program hosts framed discussions
- Response to controversial topics
- Influence on public opinion through questioning
- Alignment with or challenges to government positions

#### Public Sentiment Analysis (600 words)
- Deep dive into caller emotions, concerns, and priorities
- Overall mood and confidence levels
- Specific demographic patterns (if identifiable)
- Areas of public frustration or support
- Comparison to recent polling or previous programs

#### Policy Implications & Recommendations (500 words)
- Issues requiring immediate attention
- Long-term policy considerations
- Public communication opportunities
- Potential political risks or advantages

#### Notable Quotes & Evidence (300 words)
- Key statements that capture public mood
- Important insights with context and analysis

### 3. Configuration Options

The system is fully configurable through environment variables:

```env
# Enhanced Summarization Configuration
ENABLE_DAILY_DIGEST=true
DAILY_DIGEST_TARGET_WORDS=4000
ENABLE_STRUCTURED_OUTPUT=true
ENABLE_CONVERSATION_EVOLUTION=true
ENABLE_TOPIC_DEEP_DIVE=true
```

### 4. UI/UX Improvements

#### Removed Features (Cleaner Production Interface)
- ❌ Raw JSON toggle buttons (removed from block detail view)
- ❌ Hide Filler buttons (filler content always visible for transparency)

#### Enhanced Features
- ✅ Structured digest display with section formatting
- ✅ Government classification labels
- ✅ Enhanced metadata display
- ✅ Professional styling for executive briefings
- ✅ Enhanced summary sections in block detail view

### 5. Technical Implementation

#### Backward Compatibility
- System detects whether enhanced mode is enabled
- Falls back to standard digest format if enhanced features disabled
- Existing digests continue to work unchanged

#### Model Fallback
- Primary: GPT-5-nano-2025-08-07
- Fallback: GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-4o-mini
- Adaptive parameter handling for different model requirements

#### Database Integration
- Enhanced result object handling for dual SQLite/Azure SQL compatibility
- Proper JSON parsing and display
- Structured digest storage and retrieval

## Usage

### Generating Enhanced Digests

1. **Automatic Generation**: Enhanced digests are generated automatically when daily processing completes
2. **Manual Generation**: Use the API endpoint `/api/generate-enhanced-digest` with date parameter
3. **Configuration**: Enable enhanced features through environment variables

### Viewing Enhanced Digests

1. **Dashboard**: Navigate to the Digest panel to view structured output
2. **Enhanced Display**: Sections are automatically formatted with proper styling
3. **Classification**: Government classification labels are displayed
4. **Export**: Print and download functionality preserved

### API Integration

```bash
# Generate enhanced digest for specific date
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/api/generate-enhanced-digest" \
  -F "date=2025-01-15"
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "date": "2025-01-15",
  "digest_type": "enhanced",
  "message": "Enhanced digest generated successfully",
  "blocks_processed": 4,
  "preview": "ENHANCED DAILY INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING..."
}
```

- Processing time monitoring

### Quality Indicators
- Word count validation (target: 4000 words)
- Section completeness checks
- JSON structure validation
- Content relevance scoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Enhanced Digest Not Generating**
   - Check `ENABLE_DAILY_DIGEST=true`
   - Verify `ENABLE_STRUCTURED_OUTPUT=true`
   - Ensure OpenAI API key is configured
   - Check LLM is enabled (`ENABLE_LLM=true`)

2. **Standard Format Still Showing**
   - Verify configuration variables set correctly
   - Check model availability and fallback chain
   - Review logs for LLM errors

3. **Structured Display Not Working**
   - Ensure CSS files loaded correctly
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Verify digest starts with "ENHANCED DAILY INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING"

### Logging
- Enhanced digest attempts logged at INFO level
- Model fallback attempts logged at WARNING level
- JSON parsing errors logged at WARNING level
- Generation failures logged at ERROR level
